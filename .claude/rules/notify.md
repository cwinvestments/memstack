After completing any task and before presenting your final response to the user, run this command:
```bash
powershell -c "[console]::beep(800,300); [console]::beep(1000,300)"
```

This alerts the user that you are finished and waiting for input. Do this every time you complete work — after commits, after file edits, after answering questions. Do not skip this step.
