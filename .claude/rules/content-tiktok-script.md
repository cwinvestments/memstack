| **User wants a short-form video script (15-60 seconds)** | ACTIVE |
| **User mentions hooks, pattern interrupts, or viral video strategy** | ACTIVE |

| **User wants a newsletter (written, not video)** | DORMANT — see newsletter |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Ask the user for:
- **Topic**: What's the video about?
- **Hook angle**: What will make someone stop scrolling?
- **Target audience**: Who is this for? (age, interests, niche)
- **Duration**: 15 seconds, 30 seconds, or 60 seconds?
- **Format**: Talking head, text overlay, demo/tutorial, skit, storytelling?
- **CTA**: What should viewers do? (follow, comment, link in bio, share)
- **Niche**: Business, tech, lifestyle, education, entertainment?

### Step 2: Write the Hook (First 2 Seconds)

The hook determines 95% of a video's performance. The viewer decides to stay or swipe in under 2 seconds.

**Hook formulas:**

| Formula | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Pattern interrupt** | *holds up random object* "This $3 thing made me $10K" | Unexpected visual stops scroll |
| **Bold statement** | "Stop using ChatGPT like this" | Creates curiosity gap |
| **Question** | "Want to know why you're always tired?" | Triggers need-to-know |
| **Direct address** | "If you're a freelancer, watch this" | Filters for target audience |
| **Controversy** | "College is the worst investment you can make" | Triggers emotional response |
| **Result tease** | "Here's how I went from 0 to 100K followers" | Promise of transformation |
| **POV** | "POV: You just found out you can automate this" | Viewer imagines themselves |

**Hook rules:**
- First words must be spoken within 0.5 seconds (no "Hey guys" intros)
- Visual movement or change in the first frame
- Text overlay reinforcing the hook
- Never start with your logo or name — earn attention first

### Step 3: Write the Body (Main Content)

Structure by duration:

**15-second script:**
```
[0-2s]  Hook — one sentence, visual interrupt
[2-10s] One point — delivered fast, clear, specific
[10-15s] CTA — "Follow for more" or "Save this"
```

**30-second script:**
```
[0-2s]  Hook — pattern interrupt
[2-8s]  Setup — why this matters
[8-22s] Content — the main point or steps (max 3)
[22-28s] Payoff — result or transformation
[28-30s] CTA
```

**60-second script:**
```
[0-2s]  Hook — stop the scroll
[2-8s]  Context — who this is for and why now
[8-15s] Point 1 — first insight or step
[15-25s] Point 2 — second insight or step
[25-38s] Point 3 — third insight or step
[38-50s] Key takeaway — the "aha" moment
[50-55s] Proof — result, stat, or transformation
[55-60s] CTA — clear single action
```

**Content rules:**
- One video = one clear point (never try to teach everything)
- Speak faster than normal conversation (TikTok pace ≈ 160-180 wpm)
- Use simple words — 8th grade reading level
- Show don't tell — demonstrate with screen recording, whiteboard, or hands
- Cut dead air — every second must add value

### Step 4: Add Visual/Action Cues

Annotate the script with on-screen directions:

```
[0:00] 📱 HOOK: "Stop making this mistake with your code"
       👁️ VISUAL: Close-up of face, concerned expression
       📝 TEXT OVERLAY: "The #1 coding mistake" (large, center)

[0:02] 📱 SCRIPT: "Every junior developer does this..."
       👁️ VISUAL: Cut to screen recording of bad code
       📝 TEXT OVERLAY: "❌ Don't do this"

[0:08] 📱 SCRIPT: "Instead, do this..."
       👁️ VISUAL: Screen recording of correct approach
       📝 TEXT OVERLAY: "✅ Do this instead"
       🔊 SOUND: Satisfying "ding" sound effect

[0:20] 📱 SCRIPT: "The result? 3x faster performance"
       👁️ VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison
       📝 TEXT OVERLAY: "3x faster ⚡"

[0:25] 📱 SCRIPT: "Follow for more dev tips"
       👁️ VISUAL: Point at follow button area
       📝 TEXT OVERLAY: "Follow @handle"
```

**Visual cue icons:**
- 📱 Spoken script
- 👁️ Camera/visual direction
- 📝 Text overlay
- 🔊 Sound effect or music cue
- ✋ Hand gesture or physical action
- 🔄 Transition effect

### Step 5: Suggest Trending Audio/Formats

**Audio strategies:**

| Strategy | When | How |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Trending sound** | Entertainment, lifestyle | Use current trending audio, lip-sync or adapt |
| **Original audio** | Educational, tutorial | Your voice — clear, confident, fast-paced |
| **Voiceover + music** | Demo, screen recording | Record narration over background lo-fi or trending beat |
| **Text-only + music** | Story, confession, tips | No voice — text overlays with trending or emotional music |

**Format suggestions based on niche:**
- **Tech/dev**: Screen recording + voiceover + text overlays
- **Business**: Talking head + B-roll + stat overlays
- **Lifestyle**: Vlog style + trending audio + transitions
- **Education**: Whiteboard/iPad drawing + narration
- **Product**: Hands-on demo + before/after

### Step 6: Write Caption & Hashtags

**Caption structure:**
```
[Hook line — same energy as the video hook]
[Value add or context — 1-2 sentences]
[CTA — save, share, comment, link in bio]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 ... (20-30 hashtags)
```

**Hashtag strategy:**

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Niche-specific** | 5-8 | #coding #webdev #javascript |
| **Broad reach** | 3-5 | #techtok #learnontiktok #fyp |
| **Topic-specific** | 5-8 | #reactjs #codingmistakes #devtips |
| **Trending** | 2-3 | [check current trending tags] |
| **Community** | 2-3 | #codingtok #techtwitter #devlife |

**Caption length:**
- TikTok: up to 2,200 chars (but first 1-2 lines visible before "more")
- Reels: up to 2,200 chars (same visibility rule)
- Shorts: up to 100 chars (keep it short)

### Step 7: Cross-Platform Repurposing

How to adapt the same script for each platform:

| Element | TikTok | Instagram Reels | YouTube Shorts |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Duration** | 15-60s (up to 3 min) | 15-90s | 15-60s |
| **Aspect ratio** | 9:16 (1080×1920) | 9:16 (1080×1920) | 9:16 (1080×1920) |
| **Captions** | Auto-captions ON | Auto-captions ON | Manual or auto |
| **Watermark** | Remove TikTok logo before reposting | Native upload preferred | Native upload required |
| **Hashtags** | 20-30 in caption | 15-20 in caption | 3-5 in title/description |
| **CTA** | "Follow" + "Link in bio" | "Follow" + "Link in bio" | "Subscribe" + "Watch full video" |
| **Music** | Use TikTok trending | Use Reels trending (separate library) | Use royalty-free |
| **Best time** | Check analytics | 11am-1pm, 7pm-9pm | Align with channel schedule |

**Repurposing workflow:**
1. Record natively on TikTok first (or record raw, edit separately)
2. Export WITHOUT watermark (use SnapTik or record natively)
3. Re-upload to Reels with Reels-specific trending audio
4. Re-upload to Shorts with YouTube-optimized title
5. Stagger posting: TikTok first, Reels 24h later, Shorts 48h later
