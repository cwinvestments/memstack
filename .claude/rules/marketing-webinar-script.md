|---------|--------|
| **User says "webinar script", "webinar", "live presentation"** | ACTIVE |
| **User wants a presentation that teaches and then pitches** | ACTIVE |
| **User mentions webinar funnels or replay sequences** | ACTIVE |
| **User wants a launch plan with webinar as one channel** | DORMANT — see launch-plan |
| **User wants static sales page copy (not live presentation)** | DORMANT |

## Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Ask the user for:
- **Topic**: What will you teach?
- **Product to pitch**: What are you selling at the end?
- **Target audience**: Who is attending? Their level of expertise?
- **Duration**: 45 min or 60 min? (default: 60 min)
- **Webinar platform**: Zoom, WebinarJam, Demio, YouTube Live, etc. (optional)

### Step 2: Opening — Hook & Frame (0:00-5:00)

**The Hook (0:00-1:00):**
- Open with a bold statement, surprising stat, or provocative question
- NOT "Hi, I'm [name] and today we'll talk about..."
- Example formats:
  - "What if I told you [counterintuitive claim]?"
  - "[X%] of [audience] make this mistake — and it costs them [consequence]"
  - "In the next 45 minutes, you'll learn [specific outcome]"

**Credibility (1:00-2:00):**
- 2-3 sentences establishing why you're qualified
- Results-focused, not resume-focused
- "I've helped X people do Y" > "I have a degree in Z"

**Promise (2:00-3:00):**
- State exactly what they'll walk away with
- "By the end of this session, you'll have [3 specific things]"
- Set the expectation: teaching first, then an offer (transparency builds trust)

**Agenda (3:00-5:00):**
- Preview the 3 key teaching points
- Tell them what NOT to do during the webinar (don't multitask, take notes)
- Quick engagement: "Type in the chat — what's your biggest challenge with [topic]?"

```
SLIDE 1: Title slide — bold headline, your name, date
SLIDE 2: "By the end, you'll know..." — 3 bullet outcomes
SLIDE 3: Agenda — 3 teaching points listed
CUE: Ask chat question, acknowledge 2-3 responses
```

### Step 3: Content — Three Teaching Points (5:00-30:00)

**Teaching Point 1 (5:00-13:00):**
- **What**: Name the concept/strategy/framework
- **Why**: Why this matters — connect to their pain
- **How**: High-level steps or framework (enough to understand, not enough to fully implement alone)
- **Proof**: Example, case study, or data point
- **Mini-CTA**: "If you want to go deeper on this, I'll show you how later"

```
SLIDES 4-6: Point 1 — concept → framework diagram → proof/example
CUE: Pause for chat engagement after proof
```

**Teaching Point 2 (13:00-21:00):**
- Same structure: What → Why → How → Proof → Mini-CTA
- This point should address the BIGGEST objection or misconception
- Use contrast: "Most people think X, but actually Y"

```
SLIDES 7-9: Point 2 — misconception → truth → case study
CUE: Poll or "Type 'yes' if this resonates"
```

**Teaching Point 3 (21:00-30:00):**
- Same structure: What → Why → How → Proof → Mini-CTA
- This point should naturally bridge to the paid offer
- Show the gap: "You now know WHAT to do, but implementing it requires [thing your product provides]"

```
SLIDES 10-12: Point 3 — strategy → results possible → the gap
CUE: "Are you starting to see how this all connects?"
```

### Step 4: Transition — Bridge to Offer (30:00-35:00)

**The Bridge (30:00-32:00):**
- Recap the 3 teaching points
- Acknowledge: "You could do all of this on your own — and some of you will"
- Identify the gap: "But here's what most people struggle with..."
- Name the struggle: time, complexity, accountability, missing pieces

**Permission (32:00-33:00):**
- "I've built something that solves exactly this. Can I share it with you?"
- This is NOT sleazy — it's respectful and honest
- Wait for chat affirmation

**Qualify (33:00-35:00):**
- "This is for you if [3 qualifiers]"
- "This is NOT for you if [2 disqualifiers]"
- Filters the audience — those who stay are pre-qualified

```
SLIDES 13-14: Recap → "The gap" → "Who this is for"
CUE: Pause, read chat, transition deliberately — don't rush
```

### Step 5: Offer — Present the Product (35:00-45:00)

**Product Reveal (35:00-37:00):**
- Name the product, show the visual
- One-sentence description: "It's a [format] that helps you [outcome]"
- Do NOT start with price

**What's Included (37:00-40:00):**
- Walk through each component
- For each: name it, explain it, state the value
- Stack the value visually (running total)

**Bonuses (40:00-42:00):**
- 2-3 bonuses that complement the core offer
- Each with stated value
- "Only available when you sign up during this webinar" (urgency)

**Price Reveal (42:00-43:00):**
- Show the value stack total first: "Total value: $X,XXX"
- Then reveal the actual price: "But you're not paying that. Your investment today is $___"
- If payment plan available, show both options

**Guarantee (43:00-44:00):**
- Risk reversal: "Try it for 30 days. If you don't [result], I'll refund every penny"
- Make the guarantee specific and generous

**CTA (44:00-45:00):**
- Clear, single action: "Click the link below / in the chat to get started"
- Repeat the link 3 times
- "I'll keep this open while we do Q&A"

```
SLIDES 15-20: Product → Inclusions → Bonuses → Value stack → Price → Guarantee → CTA
CUE: Drop the link in chat, ask "Who's in? Type 'I'm in!'"
```

### Step 6: Q&A — Pre-Planted + Live (45:00-55:00)

**Pre-planted questions** (prepare 5-7 answers):
1. "Is this right for beginners?" → [answer that includes more people]
2. "How much time does it take?" → [manageable answer + success story]
3. "What if it doesn't work for me?" → [restate guarantee]
4. "When do I get access?" → [immediate, build excitement]
5. "Can I get support if I'm stuck?" → [describe support included]
6. "How is this different from [alternative]?" → [differentiation]
7. "Is there a payment plan?" → [options]

Start with 2-3 pre-planted, then open to live questions.
Answer live questions honestly. Redirect complex questions to DMs or post-purchase.

```
SLIDE 21: Q&A — show CTA link at bottom of slide throughout
CUE: "While we do Q&A, the link is still active. Go grab your spot."
```

### Step 7: Close — Urgency & Final CTA (55:00-60:00)

**Urgency elements (pick 1-2, be honest):**
- Bonus expires at midnight
- Limited spots (if true)
- Price increase after live event
- Fast-action bonus for first X buyers

**Final recap:**
- "Here's what you're getting: [1-sentence summary]"
- "For just $[price]"
- "With a [guarantee] guarantee"
- "Click the link: [URL]"

**Sign-off:**
- Thank the audience genuinely
- "Whether you join today or not, go implement what you learned"
- End on a positive, energetic note

```
SLIDE 22: Final CTA — product name, price, link, guarantee
SLIDE 23: Thank you — your photo, social handles, "See you inside"
CUE: Stay live 2-3 extra minutes for stragglers
```

### Step 8: Follow-Up — Replay Email Sequence

**Email 1 — Replay available (sent 1 hour after):**
- Subject: "Replay: [Webinar Title] (watch before it expires)"
- Body: Replay link, 3 key takeaways bullet list, CTA to offer

**Email 2 — Key insight (Day +1):**
- Subject: "The #1 takeaway from yesterday's session"
- Body: Expand on most impactful teaching point, bridge to offer

**Email 3 — Social proof (Day +2):**
- Subject: "[Name] signed up and already seeing results"
- Body: Quick testimonial or early win, CTA to offer

**Email 4 — Objection handling (Day +3):**
- Subject: "Still on the fence? Read this."
- Body: Address top 3 objections directly, FAQ format

**Email 5 — Last chance (Day +4):**
- Subject: "Final notice: [offer/bonus] expires tonight"
- Body: Recap offer, urgency, clear deadline, final CTA

### Step 9: Output
