# MemStack Pro Changelog

## v3.3.4 — 2026-03-28 — Git Audit + Docs Update

### Added
- **Branching skill** (`skills/branching/SKILL.md`) — Enforces dev-branch workflow: all work on `dev`, merge to `master` only after Reviewer confirms.
- **Dev branch** — Created `dev` branch as default working branch. All new work happens here; `master` is release-only.
- **SessionStart license nudge** — Hook fires at session start when `MEMSTACK_PRO_LICENSE_KEY` is not set, guiding users through Pro setup.
- **Tier structure documentation** — All docs now document the free/Pro tier split: 78 free skills, 81 total (78 free + 3 Pro-exclusive: consolidate, context-db, api-docs).
- **90-day graduation rule** — All new skills default to Pro-exclusive and drop to the free tier after 90 days unless marked permanent-Pro.

### Changed
- **Full git audit** — Verified entire git history and working tree are clean: no secrets, no .env files, no grace period files, no hardcoded keys. Repo is safe for public visibility.
- **Delivery model updated** — Removed private GitHub repo references. New model: one public repo + `MEMSTACK_PRO_LICENSE_KEY` activation. Customer pays Stripe ($29) -> gets key via email -> sets env var -> Pro skills unlock.
- **Docs updated** — README.md, GETTING-STARTED.md, SKILL-REFERENCE.md, MEMSTACK.md, and docs/MARKETPLACE-PREP.md updated with current version (3.3.4), accurate skill counts (81 total), and Pro tier info.

## v3.3.3 — 2026-03-24 — Production-Grade Secrets Scanning

### Added
- **Pre-commit secrets hook** (`pre-commit-secrets.sh`) — Scans all staged files before every `git commit` using production-grade detection covering 700+ credential formats across every major cloud provider and API service. Blocks commits containing secrets with redacted output. Falls back to built-in regex scan if production scanner is not installed.
- **`.gitleaks.toml`** — Project-level scanner configuration excluding test fixtures, example files, `.claude/diary/`, and `.claude/observations/` directories from scanning.

### Changed
- **Pre-push hook** (`pre-push.sh`) — Upgraded from 5-keyword regex scan to production-grade detection (700+ credential formats). Full working-tree scan before every push. Silent fallback to regex if scanner is not installed.
- **secrets-scanner skill (Lv.3)** — Documented automated hook coverage, fallback behavior, and relationship between manual audits and automated scanning.

---

## v3.3.2 — 2026-03-16 — PostToolUse Observations + SessionStart Context Injection

### Added
- **PostToolUse observation hook** (`post-tool-monitor.sh`) — Captures lightweight observations after every Write, Edit, MultiEdit, and Bash tool call. Logs timestamp, tool name, parsed input summary, and working directory to `.claude/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (daily file, append-only). Uses Python JSON parsing with grep fallback.
- **SessionStart context loader** (`session-context-load.sh`) — On every new CC session, reads last 3 diary entries and last 3 observation files, writes a condensed summary to `.claude/session-context.md` (max 200 lines). Idempotent — overwrites previous context on each session start. Checks both `.claude/diary/` and `memory/sessions/` for diary sources.

### Changed
- **settings.json** — Added two new independent hook entries (PostToolUse observation monitor, SessionStart context loader) following Option B architecture — each with its own timeout budget, separate from existing hooks.

---

## v3.3.1 — 2026-03-12 — PreCompact Auto-Diary

### Added
- **PreCompact hook** — Automatically saves a diary snapshot before Claude Code context compaction runs. Captures uncommitted changes, recent commits, shell history, and modified files. Entries saved to `.claude/diary/{date}-compaction.md` with `COMPACTION_INTERRUPTED` flag. Multiple compactions in one day append to the same file. Fully automatic — no user input required.

### Changed
- **Diary skill (Lv.6)** — Documented PreCompact hook behavior, comparison with manual diary, and session resume guidance.

---

## v3.3.0 — 2026-03-12 — Context DB & API Docs Skills

### Added
- **context-db** — New Core skill: SQLite-backed facts database per project (`.claude/context.db`). Stores structured knowledge as key/value pairs across 5 categories (decisions, patterns, components, config, gotchas). CC queries only relevant facts instead of reading full CLAUDE.md — estimates and logs token savings to `.claude/context-db-stats.json`. Includes inbox watcher for auto-ingestion and CLAUDE.md seeding. Inspired by Google ADK Always-On Memory Agent.
- **api-docs** — New Core skill: fetches current API documentation via Context Hub (`chub`) before CC writes code that calls external APIs. Supports 13 APIs (Supabase, Stripe, SendGrid, Railway, Netlify, Anthropic, OpenAI, Vercel, Cloudflare, Firebase, Resend, Twilio, GitHub). Graceful fallback when chub is not installed. Built on Context Hub by Andrew Ng / AISuite team.

## v3.2.2 — 2026-03-01 — Documentation Audit, TTS Notifications, Diary Webhook

### Added
- **rls-guardian** — New Security skill (7th): auto-generates RLS policies for every new `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` statement, enforcing row-level security by default

### Changed
- **notify.md** — Pre-prompt voice notification: TTS "Claude needs your attention" now fires BEFORE approval prompts and questions, not just after task completion
- **diary.md** — Added devlog webhook (step 7): POSTs diary content to n8n endpoint after markdown backup is saved. Fire-and-forget with `.catch()` so webhook failure never blocks diary save
- **README.md** — Complete rewrite: removed "DRAFT stubs" status (all 75+ skills are implemented), added Key Features section, documented on-demand loading, TTS, webhook, templates breakdown (8 starters + 3 utilities)
- **MEMSTACK.md** — Version bump to v3.2.2, updated v3.2 changes description
- **package.json** — Version bump to 3.2.2
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Full history backfill from project inception
