# MemStack v3.2

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![Version: 3.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-3.2-green.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

A structured skill framework for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with SQLite-backed persistent memory, semantic vector search, deterministic hooks, always-on rules, and slash commands.

## What It Does

MemStack gives Claude Code **persistent memory** across sessions, **semantic recall** via vector search, **automated safety checks** on every commit and push, **portfolio governance** to prevent over-engineering, **work verification**, and **context compression** to make your sessions last longer.

## What's New in v3.2

- **Governor** (#19) — Portfolio governance with 3-tier system (Prototype/MVP/Production). Prevents over-engineering by enforcing tier-appropriate complexity.
- **Description trap audit** — All 17 skill descriptions rewritten to say WHEN to invoke, never HOW the skill works. Prevents Claude from shortcutting full protocols.
- **Anti-rationalization tables** — Echo, Diary, and Verify now include tables of known Claude excuses with rebuttals, improving protocol compliance.
- **Silent context compilation** — Work skill (Lv.5) now silently gathers STATE.md, CLAUDE.md, recent diary, and git state before any plan operation.
- Patterns adopted from [Intellegix Code Agent Toolkit](https://github.com/intellegix/intellegix-code-agent-toolkit) and [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin research.

## What's New in v3.1

- **Humanize** (#16) — Remove AI writing patterns from text output. Curated pattern table + voice guidelines.
- **State** (#17) — Living STATE.md document tracking current task, blockers, and next steps. Auto-reads at session start.
- **Verify** (#18) — Pre-commit verification reports. Checks build, tests, and requirements before committing.
- **Seal upgrade** — Commit format now supports conventional commits (`feat(scope): description`) alongside `[ProjectName]` format.
- **Diary upgrade** (Lv.5) — Structured Session Handoff section for seamless pickup between sessions.
- **Echo upgrade** (Lv.5) — Semantic vector search via LanceDB with SQLite fallback (added in v3.0.1).

MemStack is a lightweight alternative to heavyweight frameworks like GSD — same capabilities, pure markdown, zero dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** — Install guide: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
- **Python 3.10+** — Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **Git** — Download: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- **LanceDB + sentence-transformers** (optional, for semantic recall) — `pip install lancedb sentence-transformers`

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cwinvestments/memstack.git
cd memstack
```

### Step 2: Create your local config
```bash
cp config.json config.local.json
```

Open `config.local.json` and edit the `projects` section with your actual paths:

Windows: `"path": "C:\\Projects\\my-app"`

Mac/Linux: `"path": "/home/user/projects/my-app"`

Everything else works with defaults.

### Step 3: Initialize the database
```bash
python db/memstack-db.py init
```

### Step 4: Install to your project

Copy the `.claude/` folder into any project you want MemStack to manage:

Windows:
```cmd
xcopy /E /I /Y C:\Projects\memstack\.claude C:\Projects\yourproject\.claude
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
cp -r /path/to/memstack/.claude /path/to/yourproject/.claude
```

That's it. Start Claude Code in your project directory and begin working — hooks fire automatically, rules load every session, and skills activate on matching triggers. No activation line needed.

> **Without `.claude/` installed:** If you're in a project that doesn't have MemStack's `.claude/` folder, you can still use skills manually by adding this to your prompt: `Read C:\Projects\memstack\MEMSTACK.md and follow the MemStack skill framework.`

### Step 5 (Optional): Install Semantic Search

LanceDB + sentence-transformers enables semantic vector search for the Echo skill — finding relevant past sessions by meaning, not just keywords.

```bash
pip install lancedb sentence-transformers
```

Index your existing sessions:
```bash
python skills/echo/index-sessions.py
```

Echo will automatically use semantic search when LanceDB is available, and fall back to SQLite keyword search when it's not.

For higher-quality embeddings, optionally set an OpenAI API key:

Windows: `setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-...`

Mac/Linux: `echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`

### Step 6 (Optional): Install Headroom

[Headroom](https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom) compresses tool outputs by ~34%, making sessions last longer.
```bash
pip install headroom-ai
```

MemStack auto-detects and auto-starts it. To make permanent:

Windows: `setx ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL http://127.0.0.1:8787`

Mac/Linux: `echo 'export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`

## Three-Layer Architecture

MemStack v3.2 uses three layers with increasing reliability:

```
MemStack v3.2
├── Hooks (deterministic)        — Shell scripts, CC lifecycle events
│   ├── pre-push.sh              — Build check, secrets scan, commit format (standard + conventional)
│   ├── post-commit.sh           — Debug artifacts, format validation
│   ├── session-start.sh         — Headroom auto-start + CLAUDE.md indexer + API monitor
│   └── session-end.sh           — Report "completed" to monitoring API
├── Rules (always-loaded)        — Markdown files, loaded every session
│   ├── memstack.md              — Global conventions, commit format, deprecated skill guard
│   ├── echo.md                  — Memory recall protocol (vector + SQLite)
│   ├── diary.md                 — Session logging protocol (with handoff)
│   ├── work.md                  — Task planning protocol
│   └── headroom.md              — Compression proxy awareness
├── Commands (slash)             — Quick-access utilities
│   ├── memstack-search.md       — /memstack-search <query>
│   └── memstack-headroom.md     — /memstack-headroom (proxy stats)
└── Skills (context-aware)       — Markdown protocols, keyword triggers
    ├── Echo, Diary, Work        — SQLite + LanceDB vector memory (Lv.5)
    ├── Governor                 — Portfolio governance (Lv.1) ← NEW in v3.2
    ├── State, Verify, Humanize  — Workflow quality (Lv.1)
    ├── Project, Grimoire        — Session lifecycle (Lv.2-3)
    ├── Scan, Quill              — Business tools (Lv.2)
    └── Forge, Shard, Sight      — Dev tools (Lv.2)
```

**Hooks** always fire (deterministic, zero tokens). **Rules** always load (persistent awareness). **Skills** fire on keyword/condition match.

## Slash Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/memstack-search <query>` | Search SQLite memory for past sessions, insights, and project context |
| `/memstack-headroom` | Check Headroom proxy status and token savings |

Deprecated skills (Seal, Deploy, Monitor) have been replaced by deterministic hooks that always fire — no LLM required.

## Storage

All memory is stored in SQLite (`db/memstack.db`) with WAL mode:
```bash
python db/memstack-db.py search "authentication"     # Search everything
python db/memstack-db.py get-sessions my-app          # Recent sessions
python db/memstack-db.py get-insights my-app          # Decisions and patterns
python db/memstack-db.py stats                        # Database overview
```

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `sessions` | Session diary entries (written by Diary, read by Echo) |
| `insights` | Extracted decisions and patterns |
| `project_context` | Current state of each project (auto-indexed from CLAUDE.md) |
| `plans` | Task lists with per-task status |

## Configuration Reference

`config.local.json` sections:

| Section | Required | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `projects` | Yes | Your project paths and CLAUDE.md locations |
| `headroom` | No | Context compression settings (port, auto-start) |
| `cc_monitor` | No | External dashboard API URL and key |
| `session_limits` | No | Max lines for session log exports (default: 500) |
| `defaults` | No | Commit format, auto-diary, auto-monitor toggles |

## Upgrading from v2.x
```bash
git pull
python db/memstack-db.py init      # Update database schema
python db/migrate.py               # Import existing markdown files (safe to re-run)
python db/memstack-db.py stats     # Verify migration
```

## Creating Custom Skills

Use the **Forge** skill: say `"forge a new skill for [description]"` in any CC session. Forge generates the file with YAML frontmatter and registers it in the master index.

## Troubleshooting

**"Python was not found"** — Install Python 3.10+ and make sure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during install. Restart your terminal after installing.

**CC sessions not using Headroom** — Run `headroom proxy` in a separate terminal first, then launch CC. Or install permanently with `setx ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL http://127.0.0.1:8787` (Windows).

**Hook errors on push** — The pre-push hook blocks pushes that contain secrets or fail build checks. Fix the issue it reports, then push again.

**"Database locked" errors** — Close any other process accessing `db/memstack.db`, or delete the `.db-wal` and `.db-shm` files and retry.
