# MemStack v3.2 Design — Description Audit, Anti-Rationalization, Portfolio Governance

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Approved

## Changes

### 1. Description Trap Audit (16 skills)

Fix all 16 active SKILL.md `description:` fields. Remove workflow summaries. Keep only trigger conditions (WHEN to invoke).

**Pattern:** "Use when [trigger phrases]" — never describe HOW the skill works.

### 2. Anti-Rationalization Tables (Echo, Diary, Verify)

Add two-column tables of known CC excuses with rebuttals. Placed after the Activation section, before Protocol.

### 3. Governor Skill (#19)

New `skills/governor/SKILL.md`:
- 3-tier system: Prototype / MVP / Production
- Phase constraints per tier
- Anti-patterns list per tier
- Triggers: "project init", "new project", "scope", "tier", "what tier"

### 4. Silent Context Compilation (Work update)

Add Step 0 to Work protocol: silently read STATE.md + CLAUDE.md + recent diary. DO NOT present findings.

### 5. MEMSTACK.md + README.md

Bump to v3.2. Add Governor to skill index. Update architecture notes.
