# Session Diary — MemStack + DocStack — 2026-02-19

## Accomplished
- Ran full MemStack v2.0 skill framework self-test (all 4 core skills fired)
- Initialized DocStack project: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router
- Created GitHub repo: cwinvestments/DocStack (private)
- Wrote CLAUDE.md with full project context (tech stack, design system, revenue model, features)
- Added DocStack to MemStack config.json
- Authenticated GitHub CLI as cwinvestments

## Files Changed
- C:\Projects\DocStack/ — entire project scaffold (create-next-app)
- C:\Projects\DocStack\CLAUDE.md — project context file
- C:\Projects\memstack\config.json — added docstack project entry

## Commits
- 8f49ed1 Initial commit from Create Next App (DocStack)
- 13f5441 [DocStack] Initialize project with Next.js + CLAUDE.md

## Decisions
- Used Next.js 16 (latest from create-next-app) despite CLAUDE.md referencing Next.js 14
- Skipped React Compiler (not needed for MVP)
- npm package name stays lowercase "docstack", directory is "DocStack"
- Deploy target: Netlify (frontend), Railway (backend/OCR) as specified

## Next Steps
- Install Supabase client + set up auth
- Set up Stripe for payments
- Build OCR pipeline with Tesseract.js
- Create database migrations for collections, documents, entities
